:summary: About Me

Kellan Jacobs is the best python teacher in the world. He is really awesome because he is not going to get upset with me for not editing my about page. Not only is he nice, but he is devilishly good looking. He is so good looking in fact I think I want to have his children. Yes I know that I am most likely a guy and can't have children but I really should have followed Kellan's instructions and edited the about page.

Are you still reading this? Wow I am surprised because no one really pays attention to me. The only thing I do in life is materbate with a wrecking ball while watching reruns of roseanne. Help me I need a life.
